# Design notebook for week ending November 2, 2014

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

This week, I made a start to the project. Milestones included setting up the project repository (including updating the read me for the project repository and the notebook repository to [specified guidelines](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/cs111/project.html#repo) and finishing the [project description and plan](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/cs111/project.html#description). I spent some time drawing up preliminary mock up of what example programs might look like.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

The most pressing issue for my project this week is finding a host language (or maybe multiple languages) to implement my DSL in. I am thinking about having an Excel like interface for the input of the type and difficulty pairs but I am not sure how rules will be entered in.


**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

* Any suggestions for the host language 
* Any suggestions for encoding / parsing/ semantics of constraints (as described)
* I'm unsure about how I am going to implement parsers / semantics (specifically the formalization) ... even int he abstract, but maybe I will have to go office hours for help and maybe exploring host languages will help me solidify what I am doing there.  


**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

I spent time refining my ideas - I am counting extra hours I spent last week going to office hours and writing up documentation before I knew we would have to document this process. 

| Time | Work log |
|:-----|:---------|
| 2 hours | Visiting office hours to refine project idea and writing up initial document for the mini presentation in class. |
| 1 hour| Read the project requirements, timeline of deliverables. 
| 2.5 hours | Updated project README file. Designing and creating sample program in google drawings. Doing project description and plan. |
| 1.5 hours | Worked on project plan and started project notebook entry. |
| 1 hour | Finished the project plan and notebook entry. | 

Total time for this week: 8 

This week is short of the usual 9 hours because normal weeks will usually have approximately 2 hours of critique and post critique summary and reflection.
