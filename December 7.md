# Design notebook for week ending December 7, 2014

## Description

**TODO:**   

This week, I finally hooked in the functionality of writing to Excel files. Now you can start with rules and a table and create a Sandbox Excel file. I also moved around the code into folders to create the easiest user interface: using a bootstrap file to install Python packages in a virtual environment(so that you don't have to have the actual packages) and condensing what file the user has to interact with (which python file) to just 1, called `run.py`.

Big things I accomplished
- write to formulas to excel files
- created sample programs
- using bootstrap files to create a virtual environment so that Python packages can be installed 
- moved code around to easier use 
- found out how to do file IO to different directories from  python 

**Please follow the instructions for installing and running my program and leave feedback about that process**

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

This week I wrapped up what I had into a nice download-able package.  I need to decide for the last week if I want to add more features/ what those features should be. I have decided for now not to do the validation checker. 

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

The most helpful thing this week is to download, install, and run my program from the instructions in the `README` file and give me feedback on the process. Is it hard? Is it accessible? What is confusing about it? Suggestions for improving the process?

The riskiest part of the code is when I try helpfully to open the file when you are done writing the file, by using the open command. If this crashes or doesn't work, please open up the `run.py` file and comment out line #79, the line `os.system(OPEN_COMMAND + newFile)` and try again. 

Also, I know that you mentioned to me about the idea of having a progress bar feature- but I am not sure how this would work for the each rules. What would you want to see in terms of a current value for those types of rules. 


**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a team, how did you share the labor?**

|Day | Time | What I did|
|:---|:-----|:---------|
| 12/2/14| 1 hour 15 minutes | Critique for Alejandro project, including downloading/installing |
| 12/3/14 | 1 hour | research on bootstrap file like Alejandro has, `virtual env`|
| 12/3/14 | 2 hour | Work on meshing all of files together to create a product |
| 12/4/14 | 1 hour 30 minutes | Finished tying the pieces together to make a run.py |
| 12/4/14 | 3 hours | Created sample programs, created tutorial and updated REAME | 
| 12/5/14 | 2 hours | Finished `README`, finished project notebook |
| 12/6/14 | 15 minutes | Added feature that opens Excel automatically or whatever program handles xls |  
| Total | 11 hours | |   


## Post-critique summary

Alejandro gave me really good feedback this last week about how to package up my program so that it is easier for the user to download the program and install it. He recommended the virtual environment and using the boostrap file. I have implemented both and it's really helped the useability of my program! 

## Post-critique reflection

**Planned work**
* hook formulas into Excel sheet
* refactor code into separate source files 
* create a deliverable that can be downloaded
* Update readme file with instructions and screen shots for each of the steps
* create sample programs

**Actual work**  
As noted in the worklog, I have finished all the planned tasks.
